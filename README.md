* The purpose of this analysis is to assess the accuracy and dependency of this logistic regression model.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* The financial information was a dataset of 77,536 rows and 8 different columns.
* The variables were :
  -loan size
  -interest rate
  -income of borrower
  -debt to income ratio
  -number of accounts
  -derogatory marks
  -total debt
  and finally:
  -loan status 
  
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
